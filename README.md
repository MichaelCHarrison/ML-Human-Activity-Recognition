Applying ML algorithms to predict human activity

Wearable technologies (such as Fitbit, Nike FuelBand and Garvmin Vivosmart products) have allowed for the widespread collection of data relating to physical activity. While the focus of these devices is largely on quantifying and tracking the amount of activity, the data collected carries the potential to assess not only quantifiable measures but qualitative as well. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has hained increasing attention in the research community for the development of potential applications in context-aware systems. 

Using the dataset from Ugulino et al.'s "Wearable Computing: Accelerometers' Data Classification of Body Postures and Movements", in which subjects performed barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly to establish 5 different classes of activity, I will use machine learning based classifer to predict the class of acitivy for the data set.
