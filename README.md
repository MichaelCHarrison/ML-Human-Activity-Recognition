Applying ML algorithms to predict human activity

Wearable technologies (such as Fitbit, Nike FuelBand, Garvmin Vivosmart products) have allowed for the widespread collection of data relating to physical activity. While the focus of these devices is largely on quantifying and tracking the amount of activity for the user, the data collected carries the potential to assess not only quantifiable measures but qualitative measures as well. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has gained increasing attention in the research community for the development of potential applications in context-aware systems. 

For the companies collecting users' data through wearable technologies, this provides a particular wealth of information for making business decisions. Understanding how to qualitiatively assess the user communities' tendencies can lend itself to developing additional functionality to mobile appliations or market targeting strategies. By classifying data and recognizing patterns in user activity, mobile applications could

This study uses the data from Ugulino et al.'s "Wearable Computing: Accelerometers' Data Classification of Body Postures and Movements", in which subjects performed barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly to establish 5 different classes of activity. RandomForest will be the machine learning classifier used to predict the class of activity for the data set.
